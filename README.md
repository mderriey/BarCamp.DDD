## BarCamp.DDD

This repo contains the code I showed while giving a presentation at Readify BarCamp on how to build a rich domain model with Entity Framework.

### Any chance I can replay the steps?

Sure. I tagged the repo at each step.
They go from `v1.0` to `v1.6`. You can easily checkout any step with `git checkout <tag>` as well as `git diff <previous-tag> <current-tag>` to see how the code changed.

Each tag comes with a new Markdown file - in the `docs` folder - explaining what changes are introduced for that specific step.
