## Enabling eager loading

Entity Framework supports eager loading of navigation properties to reduce the number of queries being set to the underlying database.
If we want to load a surfer along with their surfboards, the query would look like this:

```csharp
var people = context
    .Surfers
    .Include(x => x.Surfboards)
    .Where(x => x.FullName.Contains("Taj") || x.FullName.Contains("Wilson"))
    .Decompile()
    .ToList();

people.ForEach(Console.WriteLine);
```

The issue would be the same as for the mapping code in the third step, because EF doesn't know about our `Surfboards` property, but only to the underlying `SurfboardsStorage` collection. The solution is similar, though, as we have to leverage DelegateDecompiler to *redirect* Entity Framewotk to the mapped property. We also achieve this by creating an extension method, which we can find in the `src\BarCamp.DDD\Extensions\DecompileQueryableExtensions.cs` file.
