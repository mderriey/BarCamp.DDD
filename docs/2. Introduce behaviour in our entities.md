## Introduce behaviour in our entities

We've made quite a few changes in the domain model.
The entities aren't POCOs anymore as they have:

 - public constructors with parameters
 - properties with private setters
 - public methods to change their state

This allows us to bake validation rules and business rules in the entity itself.

The `Surfer` class, as an example, enforces both the first name and last name to be provided in the public constructor, and we validate both of them.
We allow to update the name of a `Surfer` afterwards by exposing a public `ChangeName` method.
Finally, both the `CreatedOn` and `NameLastUpdatedOn` properties are internally updated when needed, respectively when a new instance is created and when the name of a surfer is updated.

## How it works with Entity Framework

We might think that Entity Framework would have issues mapping to our entities now that we've changed them.
Internally, EF uses reflection to set properties so private setters is not an issue.
To create instances, EF only needs a parameterless constructor, and once again uses reflection so we don't have to expose it publicly.

The default constructor of the `Surfer` class was made `protected` so that EF can still dynamically subclass it so we can take advantage of built-in lazy-loading capabilities for navigation properties, in our case the associated surfboards.
