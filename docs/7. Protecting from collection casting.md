## Protecting from collection casting

We saw in step 3 & 4 how to hide collections from consumers and enforce them to use the appropriate methods. Unfortunately, there is still a way for them to bypass these rules.

If we look at the definition of the `Surfboards` property of the `Surfer` class:

```csharp
[Computed]
public IEnumerable<Surfboard> Surfboards { get { return SurfboardsStorage; } }
```

we can see that it returns the underlying collection as-is. Hence, nothing prevents someone from *back-casting* the `IEnumerable<Surfboard>` to its original type, `ICollection<Surfboard>`.

```csharp
var surfer = context.Surfers.First();
((ICollection<Surfboard>)surfer.Surfboards).Add(new Surfboard("Lost", 5, 11, surfer.Id));
```

We can prevent that by updating the body of the property:

```csharp
[Computed]
public IEnumerable<Surfboard> Surfboards { get { return SurfboardsStorage.Skip(0); } }
```

Back-casting is not possible anymore, but our code would fail because the extension methods were written knowing that the body of the property was only aaccessing another property, while now it's calling a method.  We can still modify that code to account for this change, as you can see in the extensions properties files.
