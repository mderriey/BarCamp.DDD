## Basic model

This the default state of our Entity Framework model.
It can be called an anemic domain model, meaning it is composed of classes that have no behaviour at all and contain nothing else but properties with public getters and setters.

Any business rule has to be enforced outside of the domain model, for example in a specific business layer that interacts with the entities.
