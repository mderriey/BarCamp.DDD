## Enforcing rules on collections

Now that our properties are backed by business rules, we want to apply the same logic for the collections.
Here, we want to prevent surfers from having more than 5 surfboards, so we create the appropriate method on the `Surfer` class:

```csharp
public void AddSurfboard(string shaperName, int feet, int inches)
{
    if (Surfboards.Count >= 5)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("A surfer cannot have more than 5 surfboards.");
    }

    Surfboards.Add(new Surfboard(shaperName, feet, inches, Id));
}
```

While this method fits our requirements, consumers can still go around it as the `Surfer` class still exposes the `ICollection<Surfboard>` which allows consumer to do something like:

```
var surfer = new Surfer("John", "Doe");
surfer.Surfboards.Add("Al Merrick", 6, 0);
```

By doing so the rule about a surfer having 5 surfboards at max is not applied.
Hence, we need to find a way to hide that `ICollection<Surfboard>` from consumers.
